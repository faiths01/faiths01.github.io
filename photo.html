	<li><a href="bee.jpg"> Sleepy Bumblebee</a>
		<p>This is a photo I took right after the sunset. Did you know that bubblebees cant fly after the sunsets? They use the sun to direct them back to their hives. Yet, if they arent back by the time the sun goes down, they will take a nap wherever they are. I saw these bubblebees napping on a flower and I captured that in this photo. </p>
		<li><a href="road.jpg"> A fall Afternoon</a>
			<p> This was taken around the peak of fall. I had taken a walk by the Sesquehanna river. I noticed how perfectly straight this road was, how the trees frammed it from above, and how vibrant the leaves were. I took the time to capture this.
			<li><a href="pig.jpg">Pretty Piggy</a>
				<p> This photo was taken at the Lampeter Fair. In the stables there were many pigs who I was fit as perfect subjects. Only downside is they are not great at listening and staying still. Yet, I was still able to capture a smile on this guys face.
				<li><a href="car.jpg"> Cornfield Sunset</a></li>
				<p> This photo was also taken at the Lampeter fair as golden hour set in. The cloud had this indepth texture that was allowing the sunlight to pick through just right, creating this vibrant and beutiful sunset. I also let a car into the photo as well as a man walking because I felt it made it look more lively.
